Twitter is a leading platform among social media networks. It allows microblogging of up to 140 characters for a single post. Owing to this characteristic, it is popular among users. People tweet about various topics from daily life events to major incidents. Given the influence of this social media platform, the analysis of Twitter contents has become a research area as it gives us useful insights on a topic. Hence, this paper will describe how Twitter data are extracted, and the sentiment of the tweets on a particular topic is calculated. This paper focusses on tweets of two halal products, i.e., halal tourism and halal cosmetics. Twitter data (over a 10-year span) were extracted using the Twitter search function, and an algorithm was used to filter the data. Then, an experiment was conducted to calculate and analyze the tweets' sentiment using deep learning algorithms. In addition, convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and recurrent neural networks (RNN) were utilized to improve the accuracy and construct prediction models. Among the results, it was found that the Word2vec feature extraction method combined with a stack of the CNN and LSTM algorithms achieved the highest accuracy of 93.78%.
