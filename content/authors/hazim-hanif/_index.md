My name is Mohamad Hazim Md Hanif and I am a PhD student in the Applied Computer Security (ACS) research group at the Department of Computing, Imperial College London under the supervision of Dr. Sergio Maffeis. My research focuses on software vulnerability detection - a topic that I explore with deep learning techniques, including sequence-based, graph-based and representation learning. I collect data from various open source C/C++ applications to train models that can learn better representation of source code using Transformer-based architecture. I am particularly interested in analysing the representation knowledge of source code and how it can improve vulnerability detection models in detecting and localising security vulnerabilities in source code. I am a strong team player and able to work independently when needed. In my free time, I enjoy playing FPS games on my desktop, playing rugby, listening to fusion-jazz songs and playing musical instruments (piano, keyboard, bass, guitar).
