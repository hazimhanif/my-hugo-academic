My name is Mohamad Hazim Md Hanif and I am a PhD student in the Applied Computer Security (ACS) research group at the Department of Computing, Imperial College London, United Kingdom. My research focuses on software vulnerability detection - a topic that I explore with deep learning techniques, including sequence-based and representation learning. I collect and data from various open source C/C++ applications to train a model that can learn better representation of source code using Transformer-based architecture. I am particularly interested in analysing the representation knowledge of source code and how it can assist detection models in getting betting of detecting and localising security vulnerabilities in source code. I am a strong team player and able to work independently when needed. In my free time, I enjoy playing FPS games on my desktop, listening to fusion-jazz songs and playing musical instruments (piano, keyboard, bass, guitar).
