My name is Mohamad Hazim Md Hanif. I am currently working as a Research Fellow at the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya. I obtained my PhD from the Department of Computing, Imperial College London, under the supervision of Associate Professor Dr. Sergio Maffeis in the topic of software vulnerability detection using deep representation learning. I am particularly interested in analysing the representation knowledge of source code and how it can improve vulnerability detection models in detecting and localising security vulnerabilities in source code. I am a strong team player and able to work independently when needed. In my free time, I enjoy playing FPS games on my desktop, playing rugby, listening to fusion-jazz songs and playing musical instruments (keyboard & bass).
